    <h3>Lipoedema - History / What is it ?</h3>
    <p class="justify">Lipoedema was first described in 1940 as a chronic and incurable condition involving an abnormal build-up of adipose tissue (Allen & Hines, 1940). It typically affects the thighs, buttocks and lower legs, and sometimes the arms, and may, although not always, cause considerable tissue enlargement, swelling and pain. It may significantly impair mobility, the ability to perform activities of daily living, and psychosocial wellbeing. Current conservative management involves encouraging self-care, managing symptoms, improving functioning and mobility, providing psychosocial support and preventing deterioration in physical and mental health and wellbeing.
    
    There is evidence of a genetic predisposition to Lipoedema, as well as hormonal fluctuations. Onset of this condition is usually puberty, but is often not identified and is often associated with chronic venous and lymphatic insufficiency, early degenerative articular disease and obesity. As Lipoedema is not often diagnosed until later stages co-morbidities and psychological issues are also prevalent and are often what is diagnosed whereby Lipoedema is the primary disorder.
    
    What are Lymph Nodes ?
    Lymph nodes (or lymph glands) are part of the body's immune system. They filter harmful substances like bacteria and cancer cells from your body, and help fight infections. They also play an important role in cancer diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.
    
    Where are the lymph nodes and how they work?
    Lymph nodes are located throughout your body, including your neck, armpits, groin, around your gut, and between your lungs. Lymph nodes drain lymph fluid from nearby organs or areas of your body.
    Lymph fluid is carried to your lymph nodes by lymphatic vessels. Your lymph nodes filter out harmful substances and waste products. They also contain immune cells called lymphocytes that destroy cancer cells and bacteria. The filtered fluid is then returned to your blood circulatory system.
    
    If you have an infection or cancer, a lymph node may become swollen. If you are any concerns, consult your doctor.</p>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p class="justify">Helen began her career as a radiation therapist lasting 12 years. She then made the decision and commenced post graduate studies, first learning about Lymphoedema therapy in 2004.
      In 2005 Helen completed International Studies of Lymphoedema Therapy through the acclaimed Dr. Vodder School, originally founded in Austria. Since the establishment of Riverland Lymphoedema Clinic in 2018, Helen has taken great care to achieve wonderful results while working both with and for her patients and continues to do so, to this very day.</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p class="justify">Symptoms vary, and not all women will experience all symptoms. Rather a combination and increasing severity as and if the disease progresses.
      Symmetrical accumulation of fatty tissue in legs usually from waist to ankles. Feet are not affected, with distinctive fat rings around ankles (if Lipolymphoedema is present this may differ). Lipoedemic fat accumulation can occur in upper arms, with fat ring around wrists
      Legs can be hypersensitive to touch and pressure, Lipoedemic fat pads accumulate on upper outer thighs, inner thighs and above, below and inside the knee often causing abnormal gait and joint pain
      
      Hypermobility
      Loss of the concave spaces either side of the Achilles tendon
      Non-pitting edema and negative Stemmer's sign on feet and hands
      Altered skin temperature, texture and appearance
      Restrictive diets have very little effect on Lipoedemic fat
      Bruising easily
      
      
      Do you have persistent, unexplained swelling of the limbs?
      Have you experienced injury to your lymphatic system?
      Are you a cancer patient or survivor?
      Have you had lymph nodes removed?
      Have you had radiation therapy?
      "What are the chances that I will develop lymphoedema following cancer treatment?"
      
      The reality is that until we have a clearer understanding of why some people develop lymphoedema and others do not, it is impossible to predict who will go on to develop it. However, we do know that anyone who has had cancer treatment involving surgery and/or radiotherapy to a major group of lymph nodes may have a higher risk of developing the condition, than those who don't. Treatment for some types of cancer put you more at risk than others; these include breast, prostate, vulval, and cervical cancers, cancer of the womb, bladder, penis, and skin, as well as lymphoma and cancers of the head and neck.
      
      You may be in the high risk group for developing lymphoedema, a disorder of the lymphatic system.

    <h3>Treatment</h3>
    <p class="justify">There's no cure for lymphoedema. Treatment focuses on reducing the swelling and controlling the pain. Lymphoedema treatments include:

      Exercises: Light exercises in which you move your affected limb may encourage lymph fluid drainage and help prepare you for everyday tasks. Exercises shouldn't be strenuous or tire you but should focus on gentle contraction of the muscles in your arm or leg. Helen can teach you exercises that may help. Click on "Exercises" and it will take you to a page where there are videos of exercises - note these are an example only. Always check with Helen first as to what exercises are appropriate for you.

      Massage: A special massage technique called manual lymph drainage may encourage the flow of lymph fluid out of your arm or leg. And various massage treatments may be of benefit. Massage isn't for everyone and Helen will assess you to provide the appropriate treatment for you. Use body lotion on your dry skin. Helen stocks the amazing Lavender lotion made specifically to her formula by the Bella Lavender Farm.

      Pneumatic compression: A sleeve worn over your affected arm or leg connects to a pump that intermittently inflates the sleeve, putting pressure on your limb and moving lymph fluid away from your fingers or toes. This forms the first half of your appointments with Helen, although not everyone requires compression treatment.

      Compression garments: Long sleeves or stockings made to compress your arm or leg encourage the flow of the lymph fluid out of your affected limb. Helen will assess whether you require a compression garment and if so will measure you to ensure a perfect fit.
